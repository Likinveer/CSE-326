 	 	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><br>When it comes to flirting and 
 	 	mingling, your goal should not be to walk into a room, identify someone who 
 		seems like your type, and funnel all of your energy into catching that one 
 		person’s attention. In fact, it should be quite the opposite. “When you’re too 
 		target specific, you close yourself off to so much,” says Kimberly Seltzer, a 
 		therapist, dating, and makeover expert at Elite Image Makeovers. Instead, focus
 		on chatting with a few people—no matter who they are—and build a hub of positive   
 		energy from there. The more people in your social network, the more you’ll be 
 		able to branch out. This is the trait most sought after when looking for a 
 		partner.</p>

 		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Whether you’re eating at a café, relaxing 
 		at the bar, or waiting in line at the grocery store, certain non-verbal cues 
 		will stop a potential conversation-starter in his or her tracks. To appear more
 	  	approachable, put your phone away, remove your headphones, straighten your back,
 		uncross your arms, and relax the muscles in your face. One low-pressure place to
 		practice is at a sidewalk café during lunchtime: you’ll have the entertainment 
 		that comes with people-watching (and encourages you to get your nose out of your
 		phone) along with the casualness that comes with the daytime rush.</p>

 		<p class="sectionTag text-big"><i><b>Position yourself strategically</b></i></p><br>
  		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small"><br>In addition to welcoming new people and
 		possibilities, it’s important to position yourself in a place where promising 
 		interactions are likely to happen. “If the entire bar is open, find a seat in 
 		the middle or at the corner,” says Seltzer. “It’s the epicenter: the bartender 
 		is in front of you and everyone else is to your left and right.” At parties and
 		events, Seltzer suggests finding a home base—say, the food and drinks table, 
 		or a seat by the couch with a few friends. Place yourself there and open up your
 		energy.</p>

 		<p class="sectionTag text-big"><i><b>Break the ice by saying hi</b></i></p><br>
 		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Seltzer has a two-step formula for initiating
 		contact. First, take in your surroundings: observe who is in the room, how they
 		seem to be connected, and who appears to be noticing you. Second, get curious: 
 		say hi, ask a question, or make a statement. Seltzer gets clients comfortable 
 		doing this by having them make three social interactions a day. “I start by asking
 		them to make eye contact with three people; then the next time I ask them to 
 		make eye contact and smile.” From there, clients make eye contact, smile, and 
 		say hi. And finally, they do all of the above, plus hold a minute-long 
 		conversation. “People in general are getting way more in their heads,” Seltzer 
 		says. “They’re worried about what other people think or feel and it prevents 
 		them from asking a question or saying hi. When you’re present, that’s where the 
 		magic happens.”</p>

 	 	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Once you’ve initiated a conversation, keep 
 	     	it going by asking meaningful questions and offering personal answers. “Move 
 	 	away from facts and surface-level stuff and go into questions about the other 
 		person’s journey,” says Seltzer, who suggests questions such as, “What brings 
 		you here?” and “Are you from the area?” “You share your journey and have them 
 		share theirs,” she says. “You can connect with someone in 30 seconds if you know
 		how.”</p>

 		<p class="sectionTag text-big"><i><b>This is what creates chemistry</b></i></p><br> 
 		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Four factors come into play to create what 
 		we consider romantic chemistry: physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual
 		compatibility and attraction. If you’re looking for clarity about your feelings 
 		for someone, assign your relationship a percentage for each factor, suggests 
 		Seltzer. After hanging out a bit more, repeat the exercise and see if any of 
 		your numbers have shifted.</p>

 		<p class="sectionTag text-big"><i><b>Do your social research</b></i></p><br>
 		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Where are the best places to meet new people
 		? Everywhere, says Seltzer. “Make a list of your hobbies and everything you like
 		to do,” she says. “And then start Googling things in your area that fit with your
 		passions.” Aside from allowing you to meet people who share your interests, doing
 		things you’re comfortable with will put you at ease. And when you’re at ease, the 
 		people around you are, too—the perfect backdrop for a memorable conversation.</p>

 		<p class="sectionTag text-big"><i><b>Identify your habits, good and bad</b></i></p><br>
 	 	<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Oftentimes, the traits we think we exude are 
 		a bit different than the ones we actually present. Request honest feedback from 
 		a trusted friend about how you portray yourself: What did they think when they 
 		first met you? Are there any actions you could take to seem more approachable? 
 		Have they noticed anything that could seem off-putting? “Getting that outside 
 		perspective can help,” says Selzter.</p>

 		<p class="sectionTag text-big"><i><b>Hang out with a group of friends that lifts you up</b></i></p><br>
 		<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">You’ve probably already heard the adage that 
 		you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. But when 
 	 	you’re looking to meet new people, this saying is doubly true. No matter how much 
 	 	you’ve practiced open body language and inviting strangers into your conversation,
 		if you spend the entire night in a closed-off group, no one new will ever try to 
 	 	break in. Leave space for newcomers to join your conversation and take the appropriate 
 	 	action to make them feel welcome.</p>
